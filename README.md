# The Goals Of Nexus 
- This website stands as a starting point to develop my skills as a programmer and a web designer as well as a way to test myself.

# Contents 

## Home
    - User friendly home page that shows the user a greeting, the goals that they have set, any reminders for upcoming events, a brief look back at what has been completed, a set of goals to be completed by the end of the day.  
    
    - We want the appearance to be great so we will be usign javascript to give a more personal touch while also using css to implement conditional scripts dependent upon the day and time 

    - Appearance : I want the greating to be there for whenever the user enters the website. I want the color scheme to be on point with the time of day and the weather, I want the first thing the user sees to be the weather and the time of the day followed by the goals we have instantiated for them.  
    - From there I wanna be able to have a comparison to the left of that panel to show what the user has already completed 

    - TBC


## workout 
    - a place for users to put in their routines, exercise recommendations, goals to aspire for, user input on dificulty, 
    
    - goals for this portion : I wanna be able to asssociate exercises with the specific muscle being targeted as well as secondary mucles. In doing so Ill be able to recommend new exersizes that specifically target other portions of the muscle 
    
    
    
    - Appearance: the workout regiment will show itself. Each exersize will briefly show a description of how and the feelings that should be felt. It will also show the muscles being affected and have a place for the user to give feed back using radio buttons
